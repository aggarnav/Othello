/**
 * This class is a model for TicTacToe.  
 * 
 * This game adheres to a Model-View-Controller design framework.
 * This framework is very effective for turn-based games.  We
 * STRONGLY recommend you review these lecture slides, starting at
 * slide 8, for more details on Model-View-Controller:  
 * https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis120/current/files/slides/lec37.pdf
 * 
 * This model is completely independent of the view and controller.
 * This is in keeping with the concept of modularity! We can play
 * the whole game from start to finish without ever drawing anything
 * on a screen or instantiating a Java Swing object.
 * 
 * Run this file to see the main method play a game of TicTacToe,
 * visualized with Strings printed to the console.
